                <h2>About Me</h2>
                <p>My name is <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/alexbrogden">Alex Brogden</a>, I am 19 years old, and I am from Manchester, England. I am currently an apprentice software developer at <a href="https://burycollege.ac.uk/">Bury College</a>.</p>

                <p>Around 2016/2017 I started to develop a fascination with music and the culture surrounding it, particularly <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alternative_hip_hop">experimental hip hop</a>.</p>

                <p>I discovered many artists in this time period, all of them producing hip hop music. I use the term hip hop very loosely as these artists combine elements from multiple genres of music such as punk and rock, rather than conforming to the traditional styles of rap.</p>

                <p>This journey into the world of experimental hip hop led me to discover one artist that stuck out to me from the rest: <strong>Playboi Carti</strong>. Since 2017 he has grown from an underground artist with a small cult-like following to one of the largest hip hop artists in the world, headlining huge festivals such as <a href="https://www.rollingloud.com/">Rolling Loud</a> and <a href="https://wirelessfestival.co.uk/">Wireless</a>.</p>

                <h2>Playboi Carti</h2>
                <p><strong>Jordan Carter</strong> (age 26) is a rapper who was born September 13, 1996 in Riverdale, Georgia in the U.S.</p>

                <p>Carter started rapping in 2011, posting his songs on the music streaming service <a href="https://soundcloud.com/">SoundCloud</a> under the name <strong>Sir Cartier</strong>. In 2013 he decided to change his name to <strong>Playboi Carti</strong> and continued to upload his songs, however it wasnâ€™t until 2017 that he began to receive mainstream attention.</p>

                <h3>Self Titled</h3>
                <p>On the 14th April 2017 Carti released his debut mixtape <em>Playboi Carti</em>. This mixtape brought a new sound to the hip hop scene, putting a much larger emphasis on the production of the songs and nowhere near as much emphasis on the lyrical content. A few other artists around this time were also releasing this style of music and it became dubbed <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mumble_rap">Mumble Rap</a>.</p>

                <h3>Die Lit</h3>
                <p>Just over a year later, Carti released his debut album <em>Die Lit</em>. This album expanded on the sound he helped establish in his previous mixtape and even took it further with songs like <em>FlatBed Freestyle</em> having almost unintelligible lyrics. This mixtape also began to include elements from other genres such as the <a href="https://www.complex.com/music/2018/05/die-lit-playboi-carti-cover-photo-nick-walker-interview">album cover</a> portraying a punk concert.</p>

                <h3>Whole Lotta Red</h3>
                <p>After a build-up of over 2 years Carti finally released his album <em>Whole Lotta Red</em> on 25th December 2020. This album once again introduced a completely new sound which can best be described as genre-bending. It debuted at number 1 on the <a href="https://www.billboard.com/charts/billboard-200/">US Billboard 200</a>.</p>
